# Shakshuka: The Middle Eastern Egg Dish That Conquered Breakfast Tables

Shakshuka is a simple, spiced tomato sauce in which eggs are poached until just set—a dish that manages to be simultaneously humble and spectacular. Originating in North Africa and widely adopted across the Middle East and Mediterranean, shakshuka has become a global breakfast phenomenon, beloved for its deep flavors, its flexibility, and the theatrical beauty of golden yolks nestled in vivid red sauce.

The word "shakshuka" is thought to derive from Arabic or Berber roots meaning "all mixed up" or "a mixture." Whatever its etymology, the result is a dish that has earned its place on breakfast menus from Tel Aviv to London to New York.

## The Tomato Sauce Base

Great shakshuka begins with a deeply flavored tomato sauce built on aromatic foundations. Heat three tablespoons of olive oil in a wide, heavy skillet—cast iron is ideal. Sauté one large diced onion until golden and softened, about eight minutes. Add a diced red bell pepper and cook for another three to four minutes. Add four to five minced garlic cloves and cook until fragrant.

Now add the spices: one teaspoon each of cumin and paprika (smoked paprika adds wonderful depth), half a teaspoon of coriander, a pinch of cayenne for heat, and half a teaspoon of sugar to balance acidity. Toast the spices briefly in the oil, then add a tablespoon of tomato paste and stir to combine. Pour in one large can (28 ounces) of crushed or whole tomatoes, crushing them as you add them. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until the sauce thickens and the flavors concentrate. Season generously with salt and pepper.

## Adding the Eggs

Use the back of a spoon to create small wells in the simmering sauce. Crack one egg into each well—six eggs typically fits a large skillet. Season each egg with salt and pepper. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook over medium-low heat until the whites are set but the yolks remain runny, about 5 to 8 minutes. Check frequently—overcooked yolks lose the luscious richness that makes shakshuka so appealing.

For firmer yolks, cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. The sauce will continue cooking the eggs slightly after you remove the lid, so err on the side of undercooking.

## Toppings and Variations

Once the eggs are cooked, garnish generously. Classic garnishes include crumbled feta cheese (which melts slightly into the warm sauce), fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley, a drizzle of good olive oil, and a scattering of za'atar or fresh chili slices. Crusty bread, pita, or challah for dipping is mandatory.

Variations abound: add crumbled merguez sausage to the sauce for a meatier version. Stir in a handful of baby spinach or kale before adding the eggs. For a North African influence, add preserved lemon and olives. A green shakshuka made with tomatillos, spinach, and poblano peppers is a beautiful alternative.

## Serving and Sharing

Shakshuka is traditionally served family-style, with the entire skillet brought to the table. There is something convivial and joyful about everyone breaking eggs and scooping sauce together. Serve immediately—the eggs continue cooking in the hot sauce and are best consumed as soon as they reach the desired doneness.

Shakshuka works beautifully for brunch, lunch, or a light dinner. It is economical, nutritious, and endlessly satisfying.

## Conclusion

Shakshuka proves that extraordinary meals need not be complicated. A can of tomatoes, a handful of spices, and a few eggs come together in under 30 minutes to produce something genuinely delicious. Add it to your regular rotation immediately.
