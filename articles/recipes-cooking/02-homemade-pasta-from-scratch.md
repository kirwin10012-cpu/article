# Homemade Pasta from Scratch: A Complete Guide

There is something deeply satisfying about making pasta by hand. The process—mixing flour and eggs into a silky dough, rolling it thin, and cutting it into shapes—connects you to centuries of Italian culinary tradition. Better still, homemade pasta has a texture and flavor that dried, store-bought pasta simply cannot match.

Making pasta from scratch requires no special equipment, though a pasta machine speeds up the rolling process considerably. Once you learn the basics, fresh pasta becomes an achievable weeknight project rather than an intimidating culinary challenge.

## Choosing the Right Flour

The foundation of good pasta is the flour. Traditional Italian pasta uses "00" flour, a finely milled soft wheat flour with a silky texture that produces smooth, tender noodles. Semolina flour, made from durum wheat, creates pasta with more bite and chew—ideal for thicker shapes like orecchiette or rigatoni.

A common approach is to blend equal parts "00" flour and semolina for the best of both worlds: smooth to work with, yet firm enough to hold its shape. For every 100 grams of flour, you'll need approximately one large egg. A standard batch for two people calls for 200 grams of flour and two eggs.

## Making the Dough

Mound the flour on a clean work surface and create a well in the center. Crack eggs into the well and beat them lightly with a fork, slowly incorporating the surrounding flour. Once the dough becomes too stiff to mix with a fork, use your hands to bring it together into a rough ball.

Knead the dough vigorously for 8 to 10 minutes until smooth, elastic, and barely tacky. If the dough feels sticky, add flour a teaspoon at a time. If it's crumbly, add a few drops of water. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and rest it at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This rest period allows the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to roll.

## Rolling and Shaping

Divide rested dough into portions. Using a pasta machine, start at the widest setting and feed the dough through, folding it in thirds like a letter before each pass. After several passes, gradually reduce the thickness setting until you reach the desired thinness—typically setting 5 or 6 for fettuccine, thinner for tagliolini.

For hand-rolling, use a long rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Roll from the center outward, rotating the dough frequently until paper-thin. For fettuccine, dust the sheet lightly, roll it loosely, and cut into ribbons. For pappardelle, cut wider strips. For filled pasta like ravioli or tortellini, work quickly before the dough dries out.

## Cooking and Saucing Fresh Pasta

Fresh pasta cooks incredibly quickly—often just 2 to 3 minutes in heavily salted, vigorously boiling water. Watch it carefully: when it floats and tastes just tender with a slight chew, it's done. Reserve a cup of starchy pasta water before draining, as it's invaluable for bringing sauces together.

Fresh pasta pairs beautifully with light sauces—brown butter and sage, simple tomato sauce, or a classic carbonara. The tender texture absorbs flavors readily, so avoid overwhelming it with heavy ragu. Toss immediately after draining and serve at once for the best texture.

## Conclusion

Making pasta from scratch is one of the most rewarding kitchen skills you can develop. The process is meditative, the results are delicious, and the knowledge that you built something beautiful from just flour and eggs is deeply satisfying. Start with a simple fettuccine, master the dough, and let your repertoire grow from there.
