# Fresh Mango Salsa: A Bright, Versatile Condiment

Mango salsa is one of the most vibrant and versatile condiments in any cook's repertoire. Sweet, tangy, spicy, and fresh, it brings life to everything it touches—grilled fish, tacos, chicken, shrimp skewers, or simply a bowl of tortilla chips. Best of all, it comes together in minutes from a short list of fresh ingredients.

Unlike cooked salsas, mango salsa is all about fresh, raw flavors that brighten and complement rather than dominate. The interplay of sweet mango, acidic lime, spicy jalapeño, pungent red onion, and cooling cilantro creates a sauce that is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Selecting the Right Mango

The mango you choose makes all the difference. Ataulfo (honey) mangoes, with their creamy, fiberless flesh and concentrated sweetness, make an exceptionally smooth and elegant salsa. Tommy Atkins and Haden mangoes are more widely available and work equally well—look for fruit that gives slightly when pressed, like a ripe peach, with a sweet, fruity fragrance at the stem.

Avoid underripe mangoes that are rock hard—they lack sweetness and have a starchy texture. Overripe mangoes become mushy and watery in the salsa. Perfectly ripe mangoes dice cleanly and hold their shape while delivering maximum flavor.

## The Core Recipe

For two cups of salsa, you'll need: two ripe mangoes, diced into small cubes; half a red onion, finely diced; one to two jalapeños (or serrano chiles for more heat), seeded and minced; a large handful of fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped; the juice of two limes; and half a teaspoon of salt.

Combine all ingredients in a bowl and toss gently to combine. Taste and adjust: more lime juice for brightness, more jalapeño for heat, more salt to amplify all the flavors. Let the salsa rest for at least 15 minutes before serving—this resting time allows the lime juice to soften the onion's sharpness slightly and the flavors to meld together.

## Creative Variations

**Mango-Avocado Salsa**: Add one diced ripe avocado and a handful of cherry tomatoes, halved. The buttery avocado contrasts beautifully with the sweet, acidic mango. This variation pairs especially well with blackened fish tacos.

**Tropical Salsa**: Add half a cup of diced pineapple and a quarter cup of diced red bell pepper for added sweetness and crunch. Substitute coconut vinegar for lime juice for a distinctly tropical character.

**Mango-Black Bean Salsa**: Add one cup of rinsed black beans and a half cup of corn (fresh, grilled, or thawed from frozen) for a heartier salsa that doubles as a side dish or topping for grain bowls.

## Best Pairings for Mango Salsa

Mango salsa is perhaps best known as the perfect companion to grilled fish—salmon, halibut, tilapia, or mahi-mahi all benefit enormously from its bright sweetness. Spoon it generously over tacos, burritos, or quesadillas. It is equally at home alongside grilled chicken, pork tenderloin, or shrimp skewers.

For a simple appetizer, serve it with lime-dusted tortilla chips or plantain chips. It can also be spooned over a block of cream cheese for an instant crowd-pleasing dip.

## Conclusion

Fresh mango salsa is one of those rare condiments that makes everything taste better. It takes ten minutes to make, uses ingredients available at any grocery store, and delivers flavors that feel festive and bright. Make a batch this week and discover how many dishes benefit from its presence.
