# Homemade Pizza Dough: Making It from Scratch

Great pizza starts with great dough. While it might be tempting to reach for a pre-made base, homemade pizza dough is surprisingly simple to make, requires minimal equipment, and produces results that far outshine anything from a package. The process connects you to the long tradition of pizza making that stretches back to the streets of Naples.

Mastering pizza dough is about understanding a few key variables: flour type, hydration level, yeast activity, and fermentation time. Once you've got the fundamentals down, you'll never want to go back.

## The Ingredients and Their Roles

Tipo "00" flour is the gold standard for Neapolitan-style pizza—finely milled, with moderate protein content, it creates a dough that stretches beautifully and blisters dramatically at high heat. Bread flour is a widely available alternative that produces a chewier crust with good structure. All-purpose flour works in a pinch, though the results are slightly less refined.

Active dry or instant yeast provides the leavening. Salt strengthens the gluten structure and contributes to flavor—add it separately from the yeast, as direct contact can inhibit yeast activity. A small amount of olive oil enriches the dough slightly, though purists making Neapolitan pizza omit it entirely. Water should be lukewarm (around 100°F/38°C) to activate the yeast without killing it.

## Mixing and Kneading the Dough

Combine 500 grams of flour, one teaspoon of instant yeast, one and a half teaspoons of salt, and 325 grams of lukewarm water. Mix until a shaggy dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8 to 10 minutes until smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky but not sticky. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook for 6 to 8 minutes on medium speed.

The dough is ready when it passes the windowpane test: stretch a small piece gently and it should stretch thin enough to see light through without tearing. This indicates well-developed gluten structure.

## Fermentation: Cold vs. Room Temperature

Fermentation is where the magic happens. For a same-day pizza, let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled, about one to two hours, then divide and shape. For the best flavor and texture, however, opt for a cold fermentation: after kneading, divide the dough into balls (roughly 250 grams each), coat lightly with olive oil, place in covered containers, and refrigerate for 24 to 72 hours.

Cold fermentation allows enzymes to break down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars, deepening the flavor and improving the dough's extensibility. The result is a crust with complex, slightly sour notes and a wonderfully open crumb.

## Shaping and Stretching

Remove the dough from the refrigerator at least one hour before shaping. On a lightly floured surface, gently press the dough ball into a round disc with your fingertips, leaving the edges slightly thicker to form the crust. Stretch the dough by draping it over your fists and gently pulling outward—gravity does much of the work. Avoid using a rolling pin, which presses out the trapped air that gives the crust its lightness.

Aim for a roughly 12-inch circle, though irregular shapes have their own rustic charm. Transfer to a floured pizza peel or parchment-lined baking sheet, add toppings, and bake on a preheated pizza stone or steel at the highest temperature your oven allows—ideally 500 to 550°F (260 to 290°C).

## Conclusion

Homemade pizza dough is a skill that rewards experimentation. Try different flour blends, hydration levels, and fermentation times to dial in the crust you love. Once you've mastered the basics, pizza night becomes a genuine celebration.
