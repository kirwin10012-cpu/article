# Authentic Thai Green Curry: Fragrant, Spicy, and Deeply Satisfying

Thai green curry is one of the most aromatic and vibrant dishes in Southeast Asian cuisine—a silky coconut milk-based sauce infused with the bright, herbaceous heat of green chiles, lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime. It is simultaneously complex and balanced, with layers of flavor that unfold with every bite.

While Thai green curry paste is available ready-made in most supermarkets, making it from scratch produces results that are dramatically more vivid and fragrant. Either way, the cooking technique is the same and yields a restaurant-quality result at home.

## Making Green Curry Paste from Scratch

Authentic green curry paste requires a mortar and pestle for best results, though a food processor works well for home cooking. Combine the following: 10 to 15 fresh green bird's eye chiles (adjust for heat tolerance), four large shallots, six cloves of garlic, a two-inch piece of fresh galangal (or substitute ginger), two stalks of lemongrass (white part only, roughly chopped), the zest of one kaffir lime (or two kaffir lime leaves, thinly sliced), one teaspoon of white peppercorns, one teaspoon of coriander seeds, half a teaspoon of cumin seeds (both lightly toasted), one teaspoon of shrimp paste (omit for vegan version), and a large handful of fresh cilantro roots or stems.

Process everything into a fine paste, adding a tablespoon of water if needed. The paste should be brilliantly green and intensely fragrant. It keeps refrigerated for one week or frozen for several months.

## Building the Curry

Heat two tablespoons of coconut oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Add two to three tablespoons of green curry paste (or the entire portion if making from scratch) and cook, stirring constantly, for two to three minutes until deeply fragrant and the oil begins to separate from the paste. This is the critical step that "cooks out" the raw aromatics.

Add one can (400ml) of full-fat coconut milk gradually, stirring to combine with the paste. Bring to a simmer. Add your chosen protein: chicken strips, shrimp, tofu, or thinly sliced beef. Simmer until just cooked through. Add vegetables: sliced zucchini, baby eggplant (quartered), baby corn, snap peas, or broccoli florets. Cook until the vegetables are just tender.

## Seasoning and Balancing

Season the curry with fish sauce (or soy sauce for a vegan version), a small amount of palm sugar or brown sugar, and the juice of a lime. Taste carefully: Thai cooking aims for a balance of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy. Adjust each element as needed—more fish sauce for saltiness, more lime for brightness, more sugar to temper heat.

Add a handful of fresh Thai basil leaves (different from Italian basil—more anise-like and slightly peppery) and two or three kaffir lime leaves at the end. These last-minute additions preserve the bright, fresh aromatics that are so characteristic of great Thai green curry.

## Serving

Serve immediately over jasmine rice, allowing the aromatic steam to rise from the bowl. Garnish with additional Thai basil, sliced fresh chiles, and a wedge of lime. In Thailand, cucumber relish (quick-pickled cucumbers in rice vinegar with sugar and chiles) is a classic accompaniment that cuts through the richness of the coconut sauce.

## Conclusion

Thai green curry is a masterclass in balance—contrasting flavors and textures harmonized through careful seasoning and technique. Whether you make your paste from scratch or use a quality store-bought version, this dish delivers big, complex flavors that reward the effort.
