# Homemade Ramen: Japanese-Style Broth and Noodles at Home

Ramen is Japan's most beloved comfort food—a steaming bowl of rich broth, springy noodles, and carefully arranged toppings that represents one of the world's great culinary traditions. While authentic ramen from specialist shops may take days to prepare, a deeply satisfying version can be made at home with manageable effort and widely available ingredients.

Understanding ramen's structure demystifies the process: it has four distinct components—broth, tare (seasoning sauce), noodles, and toppings—each prepared separately and assembled to order.

## Making a Rich Tonkotsu-Style Broth

The most famous ramen broth is tonkotsu, made by boiling pork bones at a rolling boil for many hours until the collagen dissolves and the broth turns milky white and intensely rich. For a home version, start with pork trotters, neck bones, or a combination, along with chicken carcasses for additional depth.

Blanch the bones in boiling water for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly under cold water—this removes impurities and produces a cleaner-tasting broth. Combine cleaned bones with aromatics: a halved head of garlic, a large piece of ginger, and sliced scallions. Cover generously with water and bring to a vigorous boil. Boil hard, uncovered, for at least 4 to 6 hours, adding water as needed. The aggressive boiling is what creates the characteristic milky opacity. For a simpler version, use good chicken stock augmented with pork belly or chicken wings simmered together.

## The Tare: The Seasoning Sauce

Tare is what fundamentally differentiates different ramen styles. Shoyu tare (soy sauce-based) combines soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar to create a savory-sweet seasoning. Shio tare (salt-based) produces the lightest, clearest broths. Miso tare, made from fermented miso paste combined with mirin and sake, creates a rich, complex seasoning typical of Sapporo-style ramen.

Make the tare separately by simmering your chosen ingredients together briefly, then store in the refrigerator. To serve, add one to two tablespoons of tare per bowl before pouring in the hot broth—this method allows each diner to customize seasoning levels and keeps the tare from over-reducing in the pot.

## Chashu Pork and Ramen Eggs

Chashu pork—braised, rolled pork belly—is the signature ramen topping. Roll a pound of pork belly tightly and tie with kitchen twine. Sear in a heavy pan until browned all over, then braise in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar until tender and glossy, about 90 minutes. Let cool in the braising liquid, slice thin, and sear in a hot pan before serving.

Soft-boiled ramen eggs (ajitsuke tamago) are made by boiling eggs for exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds, immediately transferring to ice water, then peeling and marinating in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and water for 4 to 12 hours. The result is a silky, jammy yolk with a lightly flavored, amber-tinged white.

## Assembling the Bowl

Ramen noodles can be purchased fresh or dried from Asian grocery stores—look for thin, alkaline wheat noodles with a slight bounce. Cook according to package directions and drain well. Warm individual bowls by filling with boiling water, then draining before assembly.

Add tare to the bottom of the warm bowl, then ladle in hot broth. Add a portion of noodles. Arrange toppings artfully: two slices of chashu, a halved ramen egg, nori (dried seaweed), bamboo shoots (menma), sliced scallions, a drizzle of sesame oil, and a few drops of chili oil. Serve immediately.

## Conclusion

Homemade ramen is a labor of love that rewards effort generously. Plan ahead—make the broth and tare a day or two before serving—and the final assembly takes only minutes. The result is a bowl that rivals your favorite ramen shop.
