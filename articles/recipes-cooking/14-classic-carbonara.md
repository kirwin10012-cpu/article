# Authentic Italian Carbonara: The Only Recipe You Need

Carbonara is one of Italy's most celebrated pasta dishes and one of the most frequently misunderstood outside of its homeland. True carbonara contains just five ingredients: pasta, guanciale, eggs, Pecorino Romano, and black pepper. There is no cream—none whatsoever. The silky, rich sauce comes entirely from the emulsification of eggs and cheese with starchy pasta water.

Born in Rome, carbonara is now beloved around the world. But the shortcuts and adulterations that have crept into many international versions—cream, bacon, garlic, peas—would draw sharp disapproval from any Roman nonna. Here is the authentic recipe.

## The Ingredients: Quality Is Everything

**Guanciale** is cured pork cheek—fattier, silkier, and more intensely flavored than pancetta or bacon, both of which are commonly used as substitutes. If you can find guanciale at an Italian market, use it. Its rendered fat becomes the cooking medium and infuses the dish with its distinctive flavor. Pancetta is an acceptable substitute; bacon, while less authentic, works in a pinch.

**Pecorino Romano** is the traditional cheese—sharp, salty, and intensely flavored. Many Romans use a blend of Pecorino and Parmesan for a slightly milder result. Grate it very finely; any coarseness will prevent it from melting smoothly into the sauce. **Whole eggs plus additional yolks** create the richest sauce; a typical ratio is one whole egg plus two yolks for two servings. Use the best eggs available. **Black pepper**, freshly and coarsely ground in generous amounts, is not a garnish—it is a defining flavor component.

## Making the Egg and Cheese Mixture

In a bowl, whisk together one whole egg, two egg yolks, and 50 grams of finely grated Pecorino Romano (or a Pecorino-Parmesan blend) until completely smooth. The mixture will be quite thick. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.

This mixture is your sauce—everything else in the recipe exists to bring it to life without scrambling it. Temperature control is the critical skill in carbonara.

## Cooking the Guanciale and Pasta

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, cut guanciale into small cubes or lardons and cook in a large pan over medium heat until the fat renders and the meat becomes golden and slightly crispy at the edges. Remove from heat and set aside in the pan with all its rendered fat—do not drain.

Cook spaghetti or rigatoni until al dente—about one minute less than the package suggests. Reserve at least a cup of starchy pasta water before draining.

## The Critical Assembly

This step requires confidence and speed. With the guanciale pan still off the heat, transfer the drained pasta into the pan and toss to coat in the rendered fat. Allow the pan to cool slightly—this is crucial. If the pan is too hot, the eggs will scramble.

Add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, tossing constantly and vigorously while adding pasta water a splash at a time. The goal is a creamy, coating sauce that clings to every strand. Add water until the sauce is glossy and fluid, not stiff. The residual heat of the pasta and pan cooks the eggs just enough to create a silky emulsion without curdling.

Taste, adjust seasoning with salt and more black pepper, and serve immediately in warm bowls with additional grated cheese.

## Conclusion

Authentic carbonara is a study in technique and restraint. Five ingredients, precisely executed, produce a dish of extraordinary richness and complexity. Respect the tradition, control the heat, and you will make one of Rome's greatest culinary gifts.
