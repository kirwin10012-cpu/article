# Classic Blueberry Muffins: Bakery-Worthy Results at Home

A perfect blueberry muffin is a joyful thing—a domed, golden top crackling with sugar, a tender crumb bursting with jammy blueberries, and a fragrant sweetness that fills the kitchen as they bake. For something so comforting and universally loved, great blueberry muffins require just a few key techniques to elevate them from ordinary to extraordinary.

The difference between a mediocre muffin and a truly memorable one comes down to leavening, fat choice, and how you fold in the berries. Get these right, and your muffins will have that coveted high dome and bakery-quality texture.

## Choosing Your Blueberries

Fresh blueberries are ideal when in season—look for plump, deeply colored berries with a dusty bloom. Out of season, frozen wild blueberries are an excellent alternative and often more intensely flavored than fresh farmed varieties due to their higher anthocyanin content. Use them straight from frozen without thawing; adding them cold prevents the batter from turning purple and keeps the berries from breaking down.

Toss the blueberries in a tablespoon of flour before folding them into the batter. This coating prevents them from sinking to the bottom of the muffins during baking—a simple trick that ensures blueberries are distributed throughout rather than pooled at the base.

## The Muffin Batter

Combine one and three-quarter cups of all-purpose flour, two teaspoons of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, half a teaspoon of salt, and half a cup of sugar in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together two large eggs, three-quarters cup of full-fat sour cream or Greek yogurt (which adds moisture and tenderness), a third cup of neutral oil or melted butter, one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and the zest of one lemon.

Fold the wet ingredients into the dry just until combined—overmixing develops gluten and produces dense, tough muffins. A few streaks of flour are perfectly fine at this stage. Gently fold in the flour-coated blueberries with as few strokes as possible.

## The High Dome: A Simple Trick

The coveted high dome is achieved through two techniques. First, fill the muffin cups generously—almost to the top or even slightly over. Second, start baking at a high temperature of 425°F (220°C) for the first five minutes, then reduce to 375°F (190°C) for the remaining 15 to 18 minutes. The initial high heat causes rapid leavening activity that pushes the muffin up dramatically before the exterior sets, creating the characteristic dome.

Before baking, top each muffin with a generous sprinkle of coarse sugar (turbinado or demerara). This creates a beautiful, crunchy, crystalline top that contrasts delightfully with the tender crumb beneath.

## Variations to Try

**Lemon Blueberry**: Increase lemon zest to two lemons and add two tablespoons of lemon juice to the batter. Finish with a simple lemon glaze.

**Streusel-Topped Blueberry**: Combine half a cup of flour, a quarter cup of sugar, three tablespoons of cold butter, and a pinch of cinnamon and rub together until crumbly. Spoon generously over the batter before baking for a crisp, buttery topping.

**Cream Cheese Swirl**: Place a small spoonful of sweetened cream cheese in the center of each muffin before baking for a creamy, tangy surprise inside.

## Conclusion

Classic blueberry muffins reward attention to a few simple details: don't overmix the batter, fill the cups generously, and start at high heat. These principles produce muffins with gorgeous domes, tender crumbs, and jammy pockets of blueberry that make breakfast something to look forward to.
