# Sourdough Bread Basics: A Beginner's Guide

Sourdough bread is one of the most ancient and rewarding baking endeavors available to the home baker. Unlike commercially leavened breads that rise with store-bought yeast, sourdough relies on a living culture of wild yeast and bacteria—your starter—that you cultivate and maintain. The result is a bread of exceptional flavor, beautiful crust, and impressive shelf life that connects you to thousands of years of baking tradition.

The learning curve for sourdough is real, but the fundamentals are straightforward. What appears complex becomes intuitive with practice, and each bake teaches you something new about fermentation, dough behavior, and your oven.

## Creating and Maintaining a Starter

A sourdough starter is simply a fermented mixture of flour and water that captures wild yeast and beneficial bacteria from the environment. To begin, mix equal weights of whole wheat flour and lukewarm water in a clean jar—50 grams each. Cover loosely and leave at room temperature. Each day for seven to ten days, discard half the starter and feed it with fresh flour and water in the same ratio.

Within several days you will notice bubbles forming—this is wild yeast becoming active. By day seven to ten, a healthy starter doubles in size within four to eight hours of feeding, smells pleasantly tangy (like yogurt or beer), and is full of bubbles throughout. It is now ready to bake with. Established starters can be stored in the refrigerator and fed weekly for long-term maintenance.

## Understanding Sourdough Baker's Math

Sourdough recipes are typically expressed as baker's percentages—all ingredient quantities are expressed as a percentage of the total flour weight. A standard beginner loaf uses: 450 grams bread flour (100%), 320 grams water (roughly 71% hydration), 90 grams active starter (20%), and 9 grams salt (2%).

Hydration level significantly affects the dough: lower hydration (65-70%) produces stiffer, easier-to-handle dough and a tighter crumb. Higher hydration (75-80%+) creates the open, holey crumb seen in artisan bakeries but requires more skill to handle. Beginners are well served by starting with lower hydration until the process becomes familiar.

## Mixing, Folding, and Bulk Fermentation

Combine the flour and water and let rest for 30 minutes—this autolyse period allows the flour to hydrate fully and gluten to begin developing without kneading. Add the starter and salt, then mix thoroughly by hand.

During bulk fermentation (typically four to six hours at room temperature), perform a series of stretch-and-folds every 30 minutes for the first two hours. To stretch and fold, wet your hand, grasp one side of the dough, stretch it up, and fold it over the opposite side. Rotate the bowl and repeat four times. This builds dough strength without traditional kneading. The dough is ready to shape when it has grown by 50 to 75%, feels airy, and passes the windowpane test.

## Shaping and Cold Proof

Shape the dough into a round or oval loaf using gentle tension. Place seam-side up in a floured banneton (proofing basket) or a floured bowl lined with a linen cloth. Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 16 hours. This cold retard slows fermentation, develops complex flavor, and makes the dough easier to score and bake.

Bake straight from the refrigerator in a preheated Dutch oven at 500°F (260°C). The Dutch oven traps steam, which keeps the crust pliable in the early minutes and allows maximum oven spring. Bake covered for 20 minutes, then uncover and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes until deeply browned. Cool completely before slicing—at least one hour.

## Conclusion

Sourdough baking is a practice that rewards patience and observation. Your first loaf may be imperfect—that is normal and expected. Each bake brings improvement. The reward is a bread of remarkable flavor, honest ingredients, and genuine craft that no store-bought loaf can match.
