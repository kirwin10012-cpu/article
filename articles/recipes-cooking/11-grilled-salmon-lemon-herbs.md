# Grilled Salmon with Lemon and Herbs: A Simple, Elegant Recipe

Grilled salmon is one of the most satisfying dishes you can prepare—a beautiful piece of fish kissed by flame, fragrant with fresh herbs, and brightened with lemon. It comes together in under 20 minutes, delivers impressive flavors, and provides exceptional nutritional value. Whether you are cooking for a weeknight dinner or entertaining guests, this recipe always delivers.

Salmon's rich, fatty flesh makes it ideal for grilling. The fat bastes the fish as it cooks, keeping it moist and flavorful even when exposed to high heat. The natural oils also prevent excessive sticking on a properly cleaned and oiled grill.

## Choosing and Preparing the Salmon

Quality salmon makes all the difference. Wild-caught sockeye or king salmon offers superior flavor compared to farmed Atlantic salmon, though both work well for this preparation. Look for bright, vibrant flesh with a clean ocean scent. If purchasing fillets, choose pieces of uniform thickness for even cooking—about one inch thick is ideal. Skin-on fillets are easier to handle on the grill and less likely to fall apart.

Remove the salmon from the refrigerator 15 to 20 minutes before grilling to take the chill off, which promotes more even cooking. Pat the flesh completely dry with paper towels—moisture on the surface creates steam rather than sear, which hinders browning and makes sticking more likely.

## The Lemon-Herb Marinade

A simple marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and fresh herbs elevates the salmon beautifully without overpowering its natural flavor. Combine three tablespoons of good olive oil, the zest and juice of one lemon, two minced garlic cloves, one tablespoon of chopped fresh dill, one tablespoon of fresh parsley, and a teaspoon of fresh thyme. Season generously with salt and black pepper.

Brush the marinade over the salmon fillets and let them rest for 15 to 30 minutes—long enough for the flavors to penetrate but not so long that the lemon juice begins to "cook" the fish. Reserve some marinade for basting and serving.

## Grilling Technique

Preheat your grill to high heat and clean the grates thoroughly with a wire brush. Just before cooking, oil the grates with a folded paper towel dipped in oil, using tongs to avoid burns. This prevents sticking far more effectively than oiling the fish.

Place the salmon skin-side down on the hot grill. Do not move it for the first 3 to 4 minutes—let it release naturally when a proper sear has formed. Flip carefully with a wide spatula. Cook the flesh side for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. The salmon is done when it flakes easily at the thickest part and reaches an internal temperature of 125°F (52°C) for medium, which retains a slightly translucent, silky center—the ideal doneness for most palates. Cook to 145°F (63°C) for well-done.

## Serving Suggestions

Transfer the salmon to a warm platter and immediately pour over any remaining herb marinade for a burst of fresh flavor. Garnish with lemon wedges, fresh dill fronds, and capers if desired.

This dish pairs beautifully with roasted asparagus, grilled zucchini, quinoa salad, or a simple arugula salad dressed with lemon vinaigrette. For a more substantial meal, serve alongside roasted new potatoes or herbed couscous.

## Conclusion

Grilled salmon with lemon and herbs exemplifies elegant simplicity—a dish that lets quality ingredients shine through minimal intervention. Master the technique of grilling fish without it sticking or overcooking, and you will have a recipe that becomes a weekly staple.
