# Classic Tiramisu: The Definitive Italian Dessert

Tiramisu—literally "pick me up" in Italian—is one of the most beloved desserts in the world. Layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers and silky mascarpone cream dusted with bittersweet cocoa powder create a dessert that is simultaneously light and indulgent, elegant and approachable. Though it feels luxurious, tiramisu requires no baking and comes together with a handful of quality ingredients.

Originating in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy in the 1960s, tiramisu has since become a global phenomenon and a fixture on Italian restaurant menus worldwide. The authentic version is simpler than many adaptations suggest.

## The Essential Components

A traditional tiramisu has five components: egg yolks, sugar, mascarpone, espresso, and savoiardi (ladyfinger biscuits). Some recipes include a small amount of Marsala wine or rum in the espresso mixture, which adds a subtle boozy depth. Many modern versions fold whipped cream or egg whites into the mascarpone to lighten the texture.

Quality matters enormously here. Use genuine Italian mascarpone—it is richer and creamier than domestic varieties. Brew strong espresso and let it cool. Use proper savoiardi biscuits, which are firmer than American-style ladyfingers and hold up better when soaked. Fresh, high-quality eggs are particularly important as they are used raw in the traditional preparation.

## Making the Mascarpone Cream

In a large bowl, whisk together four egg yolks and half a cup of sugar until pale, thick, and ribbon-like—about 3 to 4 minutes of vigorous whisking. Add 500 grams of mascarpone and fold gently until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and add more sugar if desired.

In a separate bowl, whisk four egg whites to stiff peaks, or alternatively, whip one cup of heavy cream to soft peaks. Gently fold the whipped whites or cream into the mascarpone mixture in two additions, preserving as much volume as possible. This lightens the cream from a dense, rich layer into something ethereally airy.

## Assembling the Tiramisu

Combine cooled espresso with a tablespoon or two of Marsala wine or dark rum in a shallow dish. Working quickly, dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for just one to two seconds per side—brief contact, not soaking. The biscuit should be moistened but still hold its shape. Lay them in a single layer in the bottom of a serving dish or individual glasses.

Spread half the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers in an even layer. Add a second layer of dipped ladyfingers, then top with the remaining cream. Smooth the top, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least four hours—ideally overnight. The chilling time allows the layers to set and the flavors to meld.

## Finishing and Serving

Just before serving, dust the top generously with high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder sifted through a fine-mesh strainer. Do not add the cocoa powder before refrigerating, as it becomes damp and loses its dramatic visual effect.

Tiramisu is traditionally served in a large rectangular dish and portioned with a spatula. For individual servings, assemble directly in wide wine glasses or glass tumblers for a beautiful layered presentation. It keeps refrigerated for up to three days, though the texture is best within 24 hours of assembly.

## Conclusion

Classic tiramisu is a lesson in the power of restraint. A short list of excellent ingredients, assembled with care and given time to rest, produces one of Italy's greatest culinary gifts. Make it the day before you plan to serve it, and it will reward your patience generously.
