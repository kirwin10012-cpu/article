# Beef Bourguignon: The Classic French Beef Stew

Beef Bourguignon is one of the crown jewels of French peasant cooking—a rich, wine-braised beef stew that has been perfected over centuries and immortalized in modern cuisine largely through the influence of Julia Child. At its core, it is a remarkably simple dish: tough cuts of beef slowly transformed by red wine and aromatics into something impossibly tender and deeply flavored.

This is weekend cooking at its finest. Plan for several hours of mostly hands-off cooking, and the result will be a stew so good that it tastes even better the next day.

## Choosing the Right Ingredients

The quality of your ingredients defines the outcome. Choose a tough, collagen-rich cut like chuck roast or beef short ribs—these cuts contain connective tissue that melts into gelatin during braising, giving the stew its silky, unctuous body. Avoid lean cuts like sirloin, which will become dry and stringy.

For wine, use a full-bodied Burgundy or any robust Pinot Noir. The rule of thumb: cook only with wine you would be happy to drink. Cheap cooking wine produces inferior results. Lardons—small strips of thick-cut bacon or pancetta—provide a smoky, salty base of flavor. Pearl onions and mushrooms, added toward the end of cooking, are the classic garnish.

## Building the Braise

Cut the beef into large, two-inch chunks and pat dry thoroughly. Season generously with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, render the lardons over medium heat until crisp, then remove. In the rendered fat, sear the beef in batches until deeply browned on all sides—resist the urge to crowd the pan. Set the browned beef aside.

Sauté sliced carrots, onion, and celery in the same pot until softened. Add tomato paste and cook for a minute, then add minced garlic. Deglaze with Cognac or brandy if using. Return the beef and lardons to the pot and pour in a full bottle of red wine and enough beef stock to barely cover the meat. Add a bouquet garni of thyme, bay leaves, and parsley. Bring to a simmer, then cover and transfer to a 325°F (165°C) oven.

## Slow Braising and Finishing

Braise the beef for 2.5 to 3 hours, until fork-tender. While the beef braises, sauté pearl onions in butter until golden, then set aside. In the same pan, sauté quartered cremini or button mushrooms until browned.

When the beef is tender, strain the braising liquid into a saucepan and simmer it over high heat until reduced by half—this concentrates the flavors and creates a glossy, wine-dark sauce. Return the beef, lardons, pearl onions, and mushrooms to the pot, pour the reduced sauce over everything, and simmer together gently for another 15 to 20 minutes to marry all the flavors.

## Serving Suggestions

Beef Bourguignon is traditionally served over buttered egg noodles, creamy mashed potatoes, or crusty French bread to soak up the extraordinary sauce. A scattering of fresh parsley adds brightness and color.

The stew improves dramatically overnight as the flavors meld and deepen. Make it a day ahead for dinner parties—you will be glad you did. Store covered in the refrigerator and gently reheat over low heat before serving.

## Conclusion

Beef Bourguignon is proof that the most profound culinary experiences often come from patience and simplicity. A modest cut of beef, a bottle of wine, and time in the oven produce something genuinely extraordinary. This is a recipe to make on a cold Sunday and share with people you love.
