# Top Pizza Restaurants Across the USA: A Regional Guide

American pizza is one of the great culinary success stories—a dish that arrived with Italian immigrants, took root in a handful of cities, and evolved into a diverse family of regional traditions, each with passionate defenders and distinctive character. From the coal-fired, hand-tossed circles of New Haven to the deep-dish towers of Chicago to the thin, crispy slices of New York, pizza in America is not one thing but many.

Knowing where to find the best pizza requires understanding these regional identities and the specific institutions that have perfected them over decades or, in some cases, over a century.

## New York: The City That Defined American Pizza

New York-style pizza—thin, flexible slices with a slightly chewy crust, sold by the massive triangular slice from pizzerias that stay open until the early morning—is so embedded in American food culture that it often serves as the default mental image of pizza. The best examples come from old-school establishments in Manhattan and the outer boroughs with coal or deck ovens that have been seasoning for decades.

**Di Fara Pizza** in Midwood, Brooklyn, operated by Domenico DeMarco until his passing and now continued by his family, is legendary—a single man making every pizza by hand, with extraordinary attention to ingredient quality, producing pies that require reservations or long waits but genuinely justify the devotion.

**Lucali** in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, is another institution—minimal toppings, superb dough, wood-fired oven, no phone. The line forms early.

## New Haven: Coal-Fired Perfection

New Haven's "apizza" (pronounced "ah-beetz") tradition is arguably the most distinguished in the country. Baked in intensely hot coal-fired ovens, New Haven pies have blistered, charred edges and a flavor complexity that gas-fired ovens simply cannot replicate. The classic version is the "white clam pie"—fresh clams, garlic, olive oil, oregano, and Parmesan, no tomato sauce.

**Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana**, open since 1925, is the founding institution of the New Haven style. **Sally's Apizza**, just down the road, has been a rival institution almost as long. Both require patience in line but reward it abundantly.

## Chicago: Deep Dish and the Tavern Style

Chicago's most famous contribution to pizza is deep dish—a thick, buttery crust pressed into a deep pan, filled with cheese, toppings, and chunky tomato sauce on top. **Lou Malnati's** is the most beloved chain institution; **Pequod's Pizza** is a cult favorite known for its caramelized cheese crust that forms where the cheese meets the pan.

But Chicago's tavern-style pizza—thin, cracker-crisp, cut in squares—is less famous and equally worth seeking out. **Vito and Nick's** on the South Side is the standard bearer for this style.

## Detroit: The Square Pie Revolution

Detroit-style pizza, long a regional curiosity, has exploded into national consciousness in recent years. Baked in oiled rectangular pans originally used in automotive factories, the dough fries slightly in the oil, creating an impossibly crispy bottom crust with a light, airy interior. Cheese goes to the very edges, caramelizing against the pan into a dramatic, crunchy border. **Buddy's Pizza**, open since 1946, is the original.

## Conclusion

America's pizza geography is one of its great culinary adventures. Each regional tradition has its own philosophy, technique, and devoted community. The best approach is to eat them all—at their best institutions, in their home cities—and form your own opinions.
