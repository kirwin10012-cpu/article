# A Food Tour Through Istanbul: Where Two Continents Eat

Istanbul occupies a unique position in the culinary world—a city at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, shaped by the Ottoman Empire's vast reach across three continents, home to a food culture of extraordinary depth and diversity. To eat in Istanbul is to trace the history of civilizations through flavor: Greek, Armenian, Jewish, Arab, and Persian culinary traditions all contributed to the Ottoman table, and all survive in the city's extraordinary food landscape.

The city rewards the visitor who is willing to eat beyond the tourist restaurants and follow their nose into the city's markets, meydans (squares), and hidden neighborhood eateries.

## The Great Istanbul Breakfast

The Turkish breakfast—kahvaltı—is one of the world's most elaborate and satisfying morning meals. A proper kahvaltı consists of a vast spread of small dishes: several varieties of cheese (white beyaz peynir, aged kaşar, and tulum from various regions), multiple preparations of olive—black, green, stuffed, oil-cured—various jams, honey, butter, sliced vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers), soft-boiled eggs or menemen (scrambled eggs with tomatoes and peppers), sucuk (spiced beef sausage), and always fresh-baked simit (sesame-crusted bread rings).

The Karaköy and Çengelköy neighborhoods on opposite banks of the Bosphorus both have excellent breakfast restaurants where this ritual is performed with full ceremony, often overlooking the water.

## The Grand Bazaar and Spice Market

No visit to Istanbul is culinarily complete without time in the Mısır Çarşısı (Spice Bazaar), also called the Egyptian Bazaar, near the Eminönü waterfront. This 17th-century covered market was originally the terminus of the spice trade route from the East and remains one of the world's great sensory experiences—towers of deep crimson Urfa chili, golden turmeric, fragrant sumac, dehydrated fruits, and dozens of spice blends compete for attention.

Buy Turkish red pepper paste (biber salçası), sumac, high-quality dried apricots from Malatya, and a jar of proper Turkish olive oil to take home.

## The Food of the Bosphorus: Fish and Meyhane

Istanbul's relationship with the Bosphorus runs deep in its cuisine. The waterfront at Karaköy and Eminönü hosts a strip of balık ekmek (fish sandwich) boats—freshly grilled mackerel fillets stuffed into crusty bread with onion and parsley—that has fed Istanbulites for generations. A balık ekmek eaten on a balcony over the water, watching the ferries cross, is one of the city's defining food experiences.

The meyhane—Turkish tavern—is where Istanbul's food and social culture come together in the most convivial form. Meze—a procession of cold and warm small dishes—arrives before the main protein (typically grilled fish or lamb), accompanied by freely flowing rakı (anise-flavored spirit) or wine. An evening in a good meyhane in Beyoğlu or Kuzguncuk, working through meze for two hours, is Istanbul eating at its most authentic.

## Sweets and the Istanbul Pastry Tradition

Istanbul's confectionery tradition is extraordinary. Baklava—layers of impossibly thin yufka pastry, walnuts or pistachios, and clarified butter soaked in sugar syrup—is available from specialist shops that sell nothing else, with the best considered to be those from southeastern Turkey, particularly Gaziantep. Güllüoğlu on Karaköy is the most famous baklava shop in the city.

Künefe—shredded wheat pastry filled with fresh, unsalted cheese, baked until golden, soaked in syrup, and served warm with crushed pistachios—is a Turkish dessert of spectacular simplicity and flavor.

## Conclusion

Istanbul feeds its residents and visitors with a generosity and diversity that few cities can match. Approach it with maximum appetite, follow the locals, eat in the markets and at the water, and allow the city to introduce you to one of the world's most underappreciated culinary traditions.
