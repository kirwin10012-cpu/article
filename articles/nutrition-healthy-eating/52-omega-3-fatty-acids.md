# Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Why They Matter and Where to Find Them

Omega-3 fatty acids are among the most researched and clinically significant nutrients in nutritional science. These essential polyunsaturated fats—essential because the human body cannot synthesize them and must obtain them from food—play fundamental roles in cardiovascular health, brain function, inflammatory regulation, and cell membrane integrity. Despite their importance, many people consume far below recommended levels.

Understanding the different types of omega-3s, their unique benefits, and where to find them provides a foundation for making dietary choices that can meaningfully improve long-term health.

## The Three Types of Omega-3s

**ALA (alpha-linolenic acid)** is found in plant foods and is the most common omega-3 in the Western diet. The body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion efficiency is very low—typically 5-10% to EPA and less than 1% to DHA. While ALA has its own modest health benefits, dietary ALA cannot reliably substitute for preformed EPA and DHA.

**EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)** is the primary omega-3 found in marine sources and is most directly associated with reduced inflammation. EPA competes with arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) for inflammatory enzyme pathways, shifting the body's production toward less inflammatory eicosanoids. Multiple clinical trials support EPA's role in reducing triglycerides and improving cardiovascular risk markers.

**DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)** is the omega-3 most critical for brain and eye health. DHA comprises approximately 40% of the polyunsaturated fat in the brain and is the primary structural fat in the retina. It is particularly important during fetal brain development (requiring adequate maternal intake during pregnancy) and in the aging brain, where higher DHA levels are associated with reduced cognitive decline risk.

## Dietary Sources of Omega-3s

**Fatty fish** are the richest and most bioavailable source of EPA and DHA. A 3.5-ounce serving of wild Atlantic salmon provides approximately 2.2 grams of combined EPA and DHA—more than the daily recommended amount for most adults. Mackerel, sardines, anchovies, herring, and rainbow trout are also excellent sources. The small oily fish—sardines, anchovies, mackerel—are particularly sustainable choices.

**Plant sources of ALA**: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, chia seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts, and canola oil are the richest plant sources. A tablespoon of flaxseed oil provides approximately 7.3 grams of ALA—far exceeding daily recommendations for this form. Walnuts provide about 2.5 grams per ounce. While beneficial, these sources do not replace the need for EPA and DHA for those who eat no seafood.

**Algal oil**: for vegetarians, vegans, and those who dislike fish, algal oil—derived from microalgae, the original source of EPA and DHA in the marine food chain—provides preformed DHA and EPA in supplement form. Algal oil supplements are a validated alternative to fish oil for meeting omega-3 needs without consuming seafood.

## The Omega-3 to Omega-6 Ratio

The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in the diet may be as important as absolute omega-3 intake. Traditional human diets had omega-6 to omega-3 ratios of approximately 4:1 or lower. The typical Western diet has ratios of 15:1 to 20:1, driven by ubiquitous consumption of vegetable oils (corn, soybean, sunflower) high in omega-6 linoleic acid. This imbalance shifts the inflammatory balance toward greater pro-inflammatory activity. Increasing omega-3 intake while reducing omega-6-heavy processed foods improves this ratio meaningfully.

## Conclusion

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA from marine sources, are among the most important nutritional investments you can make for long-term cardiovascular, brain, and anti-inflammatory health. Prioritize fatty fish consumption, add ALA-rich plant foods regularly, and consider algal oil supplementation if your diet excludes seafood.
