# The Artisan Bread Movement: Why Good Bread Matters

Something remarkable has happened to bread in the past two decades. In cities around the world, bakeries that make bread with long fermentation, quality flour, proper technique, and genuine care have multiplied dramatically—transforming what was a commoditized, largely industrial category back into a craft worthy of serious attention, premium prices, and devoted followings.

The artisan bread movement is not merely a trend—it is a reckoning with what was lost when industrial bread production replaced the craft bakeries that had fed communities for generations, and a demonstration that reclaiming quality in something as fundamental as bread is both possible and profoundly satisfying.

## What Was Lost: The Industrial Bread Problem

Industrial bread production, developed in response to postwar demand for cheap, convenient food, transformed bread into something optimized for shelf life, slicing consistency, and cost rather than flavor and nutrition. The Chorleywood Bread Process, developed in the UK in 1961, enabled rapid production of high-volume bread using low-grade flour, ascorbic acid, fat, and high-speed mixing that reduced fermentation time from many hours to under an hour.

The result was cheap, uniform bread that stayed soft for a week through the use of various additives. It fed millions, but it had traded away the flavor, texture, and nutritional qualities of traditionally made bread—the complex, fermented depth of long-risen loaves, the open crumb structure, the crackling crust, and the digestibility improvements that come with long fermentation.

## The Artisan Revival: Flour, Time, and Technique

The artisan bread revival began gathering momentum in the 1990s and has accelerated dramatically since. Inspired by figures like Steve Sullivan of Acme Bread Company in Berkeley (an early adopter of wood-fired, sourdough-leavened bread in the 1980s) and powered by a new generation of millers committed to quality regional wheat varieties, bakers began demanding better ingredients and returning to traditional techniques.

The artisan approach prioritizes: flour from heritage and regional wheat varieties milled fresh at small stone mills; naturally fermented starters (sourdough) or extended cold ferments with commercial yeast that develop complex flavors over 24-72 hours; minimal additives (flour, water, salt, yeast); and careful shaping and scoring that create the signature appearance and crust of artisan loaves.

## The Flour Revolution

A critical enabler of the artisan bread movement has been the revival of stone milling and heritage wheat varieties. Small stone mills grinding fresh, whole-grain flour from specific varieties—Sonora wheat in California, Red Fife in Canada, Einkorn and Emmer in Europe—produce flour with dramatically more complex flavor and higher nutritional value than commodity roller-milled all-purpose flour. The oils in the germ, which are destroyed in industrial milling that requires flour to have a long shelf life, are preserved in stone-milled flour, contributing flavor compounds and nutrients that make the resulting bread genuinely different.

Bakers like Jonathan Hartman at Hewn Bakery (Chicago), Josey Baker at The Mill (San Francisco), and Chad Robertson at Tartine Bakery (also San Francisco) have become celebrated practitioners who pair exceptional sourcing with exceptional technique.

## The Home Baker Revolution

The artisan bread movement has also transformed home baking. Jim Lahey's No-Knead Bread recipe, published in the New York Times in 2006, demonstrated that spectacular artisan-style bread was achievable at home with minimal skill and equipment. The pandemic sourdough boom of 2020—when millions of home cooks started sourdough starters and began baking bread for the first time—dramatically accelerated the spread of artisan home baking knowledge and practice.

The sourdough starter became a symbol of the desire for connection to craft, to fermentation, and to the deep satisfaction of making something genuinely nourishing with your hands.

## Conclusion

The artisan bread movement represents a broader cultural impulse to reclaim quality and craft in the foods that matter most. Bread—the most fundamental and ancient of human foods—deserves to be good. The bakers, millers, and home fermenters who have made it good again are doing work that matters.
