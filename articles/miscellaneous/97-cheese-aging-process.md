# How Cheese Is Aged: The Science of Affinage

Cheese aging—affinage in French—is among the most fascinating transformations in all of food science. A young, mild cheddar bears almost no resemblance to a two-year-aged version of the same base cheese; a fresh chèvre and an aged Valençay are made from the same milk but produce profoundly different sensory experiences. The transformation from fresh, mild curd to a complex, crystalline, deeply flavored aged cheese involves a cascade of biochemical processes driven by bacteria, molds, and enzymes over months or years.

Understanding how cheese ages—and why different cheeses are aged differently—provides a foundation for appreciating the craft of cheesemaking and for making more informed choices at the cheese counter.

## The Fundamentals: What Happens During Aging

Cheese aging is driven by three main biochemical processes: proteolysis, lipolysis, and glycolysis.

**Proteolysis** is the breakdown of proteins (primarily casein) by enzymes—both the rennet used during cheesemaking and enzymes produced by the microorganisms present in or on the cheese. Proteolysis produces smaller peptides and free amino acids that contribute savory, umami, and complex flavors. It also changes texture—a fresh cheese is firm because its protein matrix is intact; extensive proteolysis breaks down this matrix, producing the soft, almost runny texture of ripe Brie or the crumbly, granular texture of aged Parmesan where the matrix has partially crystallized.

**Lipolysis** is the breakdown of fat by lipase enzymes, producing free fatty acids that contribute sharp, tangy, and complex flavors. Lipolysis is particularly significant in blue cheeses (which are intentionally inoculated with molds that produce high lipase activity), in cheeses made from sheep's or goat's milk (which have more short-chain fatty acids that become pungent when freed), and in naturally aged hard cheeses.

**Glycolysis** is the metabolism of residual lactose (milk sugar) by lactic acid bacteria, producing lactic acid and CO₂. In fresh cheeses, some residual lactose remains; extended aging exhausts it, making well-aged cheeses nearly lactose-free—which is why many lactose-intolerant individuals can consume aged cheese without difficulty.

## The Role of the Affineur

An affineur is a specialist—a cheese ager—who takes young cheeses from cheesemakers and ages them in carefully controlled environments (caves, cellars, or climate-controlled aging rooms) until they reach their optimal condition. The affineur's role involves monitoring temperature and humidity, turning and washing rinds, controlling the development of mold and bacteria, and determining when each cheese is at its peak expression.

Celebrated affineurs like Hervé Mons in France and Neal's Yard Dairy in England have become as important to the final quality of the cheeses they handle as the cheesemakers who produced the base product. The relationship between maker and affineur is collaborative and the skill of the latter is reflected in the quality of the final product.

## Rind Development and Its Influence

The rind of a cheese is not merely protective packaging—it is a living, biochemically active environment that profoundly influences the interior. Different rind types are developed deliberately to produce different effects:

**Natural rind**: A rind that develops through exposure to the air, allowing whatever wild molds and bacteria are present in the aging environment to colonize the surface. Natural rinds produce complex, earthy flavors and are characteristic of many traditional European cheeses.

**Washed rind**: The rind is periodically washed with brine, beer, wine, cider, or spirits during aging. This promotes the growth of Brevibacterium linens—the orange-pigmented bacteria responsible for the characteristic pungent, meaty aromas of washed-rind cheeses like Époisses, Limburger, and Taleggio.

**Bloomy rind**: Penicillium candidum mold is sprayed onto the surface of soft-ripened cheeses like Brie and Camembert, creating the characteristic white, downy exterior. This mold produces proteases that ripen the cheese from the outside in, creating the runny, complex layer just beneath the rind in a properly matured example.

## Conclusion

Cheese aging is a science and an art—a collaboration between the cheesemaker, the microorganisms they cultivate, and the affineur who coaxes the transformation to completion. Every bite of well-aged cheese is the product of this extended, complex process, and understanding it deepens appreciation for what is, without exaggeration, one of humanity's greatest culinary achievements.
