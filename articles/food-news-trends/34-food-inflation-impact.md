# How Food Inflation Is Changing What We Eat

The surge in food prices that accelerated through 2021, 2022, and into 2023 has had profound effects on what consumers buy, what restaurants serve, and how food systems operate. Global food inflation—driven by a confluence of supply chain disruptions, energy price increases, the war in Ukraine (a major exporter of wheat and sunflower oil), drought in key agricultural regions, and ongoing pandemic-related disruptions—has created a cost-of-living crisis with food at its center.

For households already facing financial pressure, food inflation is not merely inconvenient—it is a crisis that shapes daily decisions, nutrition, and quality of life. Understanding how it affects our plates is essential for navigating it thoughtfully.

## The Causes of Food Inflation

Food prices are determined by a complex web of interconnected factors. Energy costs permeate the entire food system: fuel powers farm equipment, fertilizer is produced from natural gas, refrigerated transport requires diesel, and processing facilities consume electricity. When energy prices spike—as they did following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022—food prices follow with some lag.

Fertilizer costs, which had already risen significantly due to supply chain issues, spiked further when Russia's export restrictions cut off a major global source. Reduced global wheat and sunflower oil supplies from Ukraine and Russia created direct price pressure on bread, pasta, and cooking oils. Extreme weather events—droughts in the American West and Europe, floods in Asia—damaged crop yields across multiple commodities simultaneously.

## How Consumers Are Responding

Survey data and behavioral research consistently show that food inflation changes consumption patterns in predictable ways. Consumers trade down—moving from premium to store brands, from fresh to frozen, from expensive proteins to cheaper ones. Beef consumption declines as prices rise; chicken, eggs, and legumes increase in relative consumption. Restaurant visits decrease, particularly at full-service restaurants, while fast food (with its commodity-driven pricing and scale efficiencies) proves more resilient.

Home cooking increases—not necessarily out of desire but out of economic necessity. Meal kit companies, which offer a middle ground between home cooking and restaurant dining, initially benefited but faced subsequent attrition as consumers recalibrated their food spending.

## Restaurants Under Pressure

Restaurants operate on notoriously thin margins—typically 3 to 9% of revenue in full-service establishments—and food cost increases are immediately and severely felt. The typical food cost target of 28-35% of revenue became nearly impossible to maintain when ingredient prices rose 15-20% while menu price increases of similar magnitude risk alienating price-sensitive customers.

Many restaurants have responded by shrinking portions, reducing menu complexity, substituting ingredients, and raising prices selectively. Fast food chains have implemented aggressive value promotions to retain customers while raising prices on premium items. The net effect is a menu landscape that has been meaningfully reshaped by inflation pressures.

## Structural Implications for Food Access

Food inflation is not democratically distributed. Lower-income households spend a significantly higher share of their income on food than higher-income households—food insecurity and hunger worsen as prices rise. The use of food banks and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits increased substantially during the inflation surge. The social safety net was tested as prices for staples—eggs, bread, chicken—rose dramatically.

The policy response, including enhanced SNAP benefits and school meal programs, helped buffer the impact for many families. But millions fell through the gaps in coverage.

## Conclusion

Food inflation has reshaped dinner tables, restaurant menus, and food policy in ways that will have lasting effects. Understanding its causes and consequences helps consumers make more informed choices, advocates make stronger arguments for food access programs, and policymakers design more resilient food systems.
