# Sustainable Seafood: How to Make Better Choices at the Fish Counter

Seafood occupies a unique place in the global food system: it is one of the world's most important sources of animal protein, feeding billions of people; it is one of the most nutritionally dense foods available; and its continued availability is under profound threat from overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. Understanding how to make sustainable seafood choices is one of the most meaningful ways consumers can support healthier oceans.

The good news is that making better choices doesn't mean giving up seafood—it means being more informed about where your fish comes from and how it was caught or farmed.

## The Scale of the Problem

An estimated 35% of global fish stocks are now overfished, with many iconic species severely depleted. Atlantic bluefin tuna, certain populations of cod, swordfish in some regions, and orange roughy are among the species that have faced catastrophic population declines from commercial overfishing. Destructive fishing methods—bottom trawling in particular—cause enormous damage to seafloor habitats, capturing vast quantities of non-target species (bycatch) in the process.

The aquaculture industry (fish farming) has expanded dramatically to fill the gap, but not all aquaculture is created equal. Some operations—shrimp farms that have cleared mangrove forests, open-net salmon pens that allow disease and parasites to spread to wild populations—have caused significant environmental damage. Others, particularly closed-system recirculating aquaculture, represent genuinely low-impact alternatives.

## Using Sustainability Guides

Organizations like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program have developed certification systems and consumer guides that make it easier to identify sustainable choices. MSC certification—the blue fish label—indicates wild-caught seafood from fisheries that meet rigorous standards for stock health, ecosystem impact, and management. The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) performs a similar function for farmed seafood.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch app and website provide region-specific recommendations, rating seafood as "Best Choice," "Good Alternative," or "Avoid." These resources are free, regularly updated, and remarkably useful at the point of purchase.

## Species to Prioritize and Species to Avoid

Generally, small pelagic fish—sardines, mackerel, anchovies, herring—are among the most sustainable seafood choices. They are abundant, fast-reproducing, low on the food chain, and rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Farmed mussels, clams, and oysters are excellent choices: filter feeders that require no feed inputs and actually improve water quality.

Wild Alaskan salmon (particularly sockeye and pink), Pacific halibut from Alaska, and U.S. farmed catfish and trout are widely cited as responsible choices. Among species to limit or avoid: imported shrimp from regions with poor environmental oversight, farmed Atlantic salmon from net-pen operations, and wild-caught seafood from poorly managed fisheries.

## What to Ask at Your Fish Counter

Asking questions at the seafood counter is one of the most powerful acts a consumer can take. "Where is this from?" and "How was it caught or farmed?" are reasonable questions that any responsible retailer should be able to answer. Buying from fishmongers with strong provenance commitments, choosing locally caught fish when available, and varying your seafood choices to spread demand across more species all contribute to a more sustainable approach.

## Conclusion

Sustainable seafood choices are not about perfection—they are about awareness and incremental improvement. By using available tools, asking questions, and diversifying the species we eat, consumers can contribute meaningfully to the long-term health of ocean ecosystems while continuing to enjoy one of the world's great food categories.
